# Timon & Pumba

Scripts for creating sites for earning on the automatic machine Only there self-scripted script had the form of a gallery, and here the sites have the form of blogs.

The topic of sites and languages ​​are still unlimited.
The cost is also minimal, the time of creation of the site is also about 1 hour. The methods of monetization are the same.
There are 6 templates with scripts. New ones are easy to do.

What is the difference?
Timon uses the sqlite database and stores only brief news in it - the complete ones are formed "on the fly."
Pumbaa can also parse text. He uses the mysql database and stores a brief and full news in it.
On it you can do similar things: https://youtu.be/YJwnB_-3eyI Examples of Timon:
